# Learn User Experience Testing
Learn how to test your app with real humans

## Why?
This is _probably_ the most important/useful skill any "_creative technologist_"
has. 💪

Well conducted user experience testing helps you ensure that what you are
planning to build is going to solve the problem for your users that you set out
to solve. ✅

It prevents you from wasting time ⏳/ effort 😓/ money 💰on guessing 🤔❓what your
users will want, need or understand by getting them to critique your product as
you go rather than retrospectively.

Testing usability and following usability guidelines is not something we have to
do to restrict ourselves or because we're told to. Understanding usability is
about ensuring users can use our product effectively and so without it our
product will be less successful. 📉👎  

## What?
User experience testing is a means of collecting feedback 🗣from users on the
evolution of your product.

It can be performed multiple times in a cycle of:  🗣❌👎gathering feedback on
your designs from users -> adapting your designs in light of user feedback 🤔 ✏️
-> getting feedback on your amended designs to see if they now meet the users'
needs 🗣✅👍. Once you are satisfied the users needs have been met then you can
begin to build the agreed designs. 🏗 👷‍♀️ 👷

## How?

There are many approaches to user experience testing that you may choose to use
based on your product, stage of product development, budget 💵, client base 👥 etc.:

The first stage of user testing you may wish to conduct is known as the discovery
phase, for information on this stage see: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works

To perform usability user testing you may use one/some of the following methods:

* interviews
* Surveys/ questionnaires
* Usage pattern analysis using "analytics" data. For more on this see:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-analytics 📊
* Screen recordings #1 🎥🖥
* App usage/demo video capture

Ensure that when you conduct tests you are testing them across devices so that
your data reflects all of your users experiences e.g. mobile 📱, tablet and
desktop 💻 .

### How to conduct interviews
1. Create a **script** to run through with your testers 📃
2. Decide **who** you will interview 👥
3. Find some**where** appropriate to conduct your interviews 🏢
4. Decide on a **time/date** to perform your research 📆 🕐
5. Decide **who** in the team will **conduct the interviews** 👩‍💼👨‍💼
6. Decide **how many** interviews you wish to do
6. Decide how you will **record the findings** of your interviews. 📝🔉🎥

**1. Writing a script 🖊**
A script is a helpful way of ensuring interviews are delivered in a consistent
way (if different team members conduct them) and that the interviewer can feel
relaxed ☺️ because they know what they've got to say. It's important that scripts
aren't read like an autocue 🤖 as you want the tester to feel relaxed too, so
making them more like a normal conversation is beneficial. However if you are
anxious 😰 about missing something out, one way to deal with this is to tell the
participant 'I'm going to read through this part of the process to make sure I
don't leave anything out'. By telling them what you are doing and why it can
help alleviate worries they may have constructed otherwise, you're telling them
that you're reading it so they benefit from all of the information, not because
this is a formal setting and you're avoiding their eye contact 👀😊! So make sure
the team familiarises themselves with the script before they start. The script
doesn't need to be followed word for word but team members should bare in mind
that certain word choices are important in order to not influence the testers
responses. Here is a useful script outline that might be of use for some
projects: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM2Uaje8gpBde-RqU01DlxrGUEsWZrjiy8yTKmYaeJYAZUuw/viewform

These are some of the key points from it and other resources (see list at the
bottom of readme):

#### Introduction
- Ensure your screen is set to something non-distracting (not a view of the
  product) during the introduction to the session e.g. a blank google search page
- Thank the tester for taking part ❤️
- Explain the context of the research e.g. ‘We're asking people to try using a
website we're working on to make sure it works as intended...’
- Explain what they should expect e.g. ‘in a minute I will show you the
application and I’ll ask you some questions about it, it will take about 10 minutes…’
- Explain what is expected of them e.g. ‘as you go through the application I
want you to think aloud, to voice whatever you’re thinking or feeling as you go
through it’ - this ‘**think aloud**’ method is crucial for getting inside a
user’s head. 💭🤔💬
- Encourage honesty and help them relax by letting them know there are no right
or wrong answers, you are not testing them. ’please be honest, this is a test of
the application not of you’
- 'If you have any questions as you go through the test feel free to ask them' -
I may not be able to answer them right away since we're interested in how people
do when they don't have someone sitting next to them to help but I'll make sure
to answer them at the end.'
- Inform the tester if you are going to record any of your test (e.g. screen
  recording 📹 or audio recording 🔉) and what the recording will be used for
  'it will only be seen/heard by people working on the site, it will not be used
  outside of the project.' 'Recording the test helps me as I don't have to take
  as many notes...' 📝
- Ask them if they have any questions after your introduction, before you start
showing them the application.

#### Initial Questions
- Basic questions about the participant that are easy for them to answer and not
too sensitive. This helps them warm up and also helps you learn a bit more about
them as a user. E.g. what's your occupation? 👨‍🍳 👩‍🚀 🕵️ 👩‍🎨
- You might want to learn more about their habits with technology to gain an
understanding of how technologically competent they are (giving context to their
  responses) or whether they're familiar with the device you are testing your
  product with them on in that test ie. are they an android or iOS user 📱.

#### Exploring your wireframes / product 🔎
- For a homepage exploration you might prompt them with these questions before
showing them the page: 'Look at this page and tell me what you about it...'
'Whose site do you think it is?' 'What strikes you about it? What you think you
could do here? What you think this site is for?'
- For testing a specific flow or user journey tell them about the task you want
them to try and complete. You can read out the task aloud and give the
participant a written copy for their reference. The task should give the user a
scenario to follow, that might include any relevant background details about
them, why they are on your site, how they came to know about the site and what
they are looking to do on the site.
- Reiterate that you want the participant to think out loud as they go along. 💭🤔💬

- Ask them about other applications they might use that relate to your product.
Consider carefully whether you do this before or after showing them your own
application. The order in which you do things will prime the tester to have
whatever you have just discussed on their mind, consider whether this is helpful
in the context of your research or not.
- Wrap up and ensure to ask your tester if they’d like to ask you anything. It’s
not only polite but also sometimes reveals subjects that the test failed to
capture. ‘I think that’s everything, do you have any questions for me?’
- Be comfortable with silence 😶👍, when someone is exploring the application
don't fill the awkward silences by telling them what to do next, wait for them
to talk. Responses like 'I'm not sure what to do now, where does this page go?'
are really useful because they show you that your designs are not self explanatory.
- Avoid using all yes/no answer, open ended questions encourage people to give
more detail and depth of analysis
- Be mindful of the language you use to respond to the tester, if a tester is
talking about whether they like the app or not, saying 'ok' in confirmation
rather than 'good' is more neutral. Saying 'good' would suggest that you are
pleased with their response and may influence them to give other answers they
think you would like to hear.

**2. Who 👥**
If you have existing users for your product reach out to them and ask if any of
them would like to participate in some research to help improve the product. If
you don't have any existing users yet, aim to test your application on people
who represent your target user group. Even when you do have an existing user
base, testing with people who are new to your product can offer a different
perspective to those who already know it and what it does. If you are struggling
to find participants encouraging people by informing them of how long it takes
to participate (10mins is reasonable) or you can offer something to thank them
for participating e.g. buy them a coffee ☕️ if you are in a coffee shop. Just be
mindful that you don't want what you offer as a thank you to impact what
responses they give. You may get a better response rate for participation from
people who are on their own 👤.

**3. Where 🗺**
Key for determining where to conduct your interviews are:
- **proximity and comfort** - how relaxed will your interviewee feel where
you're meeting them, is it easy for them to get to, would they feel relaxed in
that environment? is there somewhere comfortable for you to both sit? is it too
noisy? or is what you're discussing potentially sensitive so is the environment
private enough?
- **practicality** - what space do you have available to you for your
time/budget? 🕐💰do you have a meeting room that you can use? If not, what about
a public space like a coffee shop ☕️or somewhere relevant to your product e.g. a
leisure centre if your product is a fitness application 🏋️‍♀️.
- **bias** - will the location of your interview influence your interviewees
response in any way? Ie. would a staff member respond differently to a question
about procrastination at work when asked in their open plan office in front of
their colleagues in comparison to if you asked them in a setting outside of
their office? or in a private space?

**4. When 🕥🕚**
When is a time that suits you and your interviewees. If you're looking to source
interviewees on the day when is a time that your chosen location is likely to
have plenty of people around e.g. office hours for an office, would people be
happier to talk on their lunch break or are they likely to leave the office
altogether? Does the day of the week or time of year make a difference 🌞🍂❄️?
Are there any key events within your company or in the public eye that would be
good to coordinate with to conduct your research 🎃🎄💘? E.g. conducting research
in January to coordinate with '[Dry January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_January)'
when researching for a product aimed at people interested in low/no alcohol drinks options.

**5. Who will conduct interviews**
1 or 2 people is sufficient (you don't want to make your tester feel
uncomfortable). Everyone involved in your product should go at some point
(developers too!)

**6. How many interviews**
Up to **85% of core usability problems** can be found by **observing just 5
people using your application** according to Jakob Nielsen (see
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YL0xoSmyZI and
  https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/). The
  reason for this is that the core usability problems are easy to spot for
  people who are new to your application (and difficult for you to spot as you
  are too close to the product to see how real people perceive it for the first
  time). The 'magic 5' approach suggests that you find out the most from the
  first person you to speak to and then a little less from the next person and
  so forth.

**7. Recording the findings of your interviews 📝 and interpreting them 📊❓**
Agree before you conduct your interview who is going to take notes and in what
format or whether you're going to record the session (the screen or audio).
Think about how you will later collate your results to see patterns from them.
Once you have all of your findings discuss them with your team to find trends
and see how you can make improvements based upon them.

Testing with small sample sizes like 4 or 5 people is worthwhile when often the
alternative is no testing at all. However, you shouldn't rely on statistics from
such small groups. So if 1/4 people take issue with something don't consider it
25% and therefore something that must be changed. Consider what the issue for
that 1 person was and interpret it with your knowledge to deduce if you should
change the designs based on their response. Remember that small and simple
amends are just as good, if not better than a total redesign. Just because you
have areas to improve on doesn't mean you should start again from scratch. Also
remember it's better to make your existing product work rather than adding new
feature after new feature when the original product isn't working well for users
yet.  If you have made changes to the existing product and people are reacting
badly to them remember that aversion to change is normal. Give it a bit of time
to allow users to adjust to the new designs or leave assistance mechanisms to
point people in the right direction to teach them the new way of doing things.

**Be conscious of bias** - think about how every aspect of your set up
(time/location, interviewee demographic, script etc.) could influence the
responses you gained in conducting your research. Could interviewing loved ones
about your idea expose only the positives of your idea because they don't want
to give you negative feedback for fear of hurting you?
